# LuckyS-Guild-Clash-Apps
This apps is inspired by an online game Growtopia which every month will hold an event called "GrowEvent" or "Clash Event". Read more about that event here:

I joined an in game guild community named LuckyS Guild. Our guild have some rule for members that joined in our guild:

MAIN RULE:
Every member must participate and contribute in Clash Event with his/her contribution point reaches a certain milestone. If they don't fulfill this condition, then they will be kicked from the guild.
Next, if a member want to be promoted to Guild Elder position, their contribution point should reach a certain milestone that of course higher than member's target point in two respective Clash Events. For that, we will record in every Clash Event, which members those reach Guild Elder's target point and if next event they reach the corresponding month's target point, they will be promoted.
This condition similarly applies to Guild Elder, if their point is below Guild Elder's target point in two respective events, they will be demoted to member and we also record this.

ANOTHER RULE:
Every member also must deposit some amount of in game currency in guild's storage world before the clash event starts. The deposit can be returned to them if their point is above member's target point, else the deposit will be taken (the member will be considered as skipping clash).
If a Guild Elder do deposit but their point is above member's target point, they will be included in demote list because they actually can contribute but they don't contribute optimally until they reach Guild Elder's target point.

# Features
So this apps can read data from a .txt file instead of type the data one by one. After reading some inputs, then we can see the inputted data, then which members to kick, which members to add to the promote/demote list, which members to have their deposit taken.
This apps can also create discord leaderboard text that also will be written in a .txt file and we can copy the text to post the result in our discord too.
